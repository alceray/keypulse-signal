# KeyPulse Production Readiness Plan

## Phase 1 - Stabilize startup and configuration

### Goal

Make startup behavior deterministic and aligned with intended product behavior.

### Work items

#### 1.1 Standardize startup mode strategy

- **Files:** `App.xaml.cs`
- **Status:** Completed.
- **Implemented:** Startup mode resolution centralized in `ResolveRunInBackground()` with clear precedence:
  1. launch argument `--tray` forces tray mode for that process
  2. otherwise build default applies: `Debug` => foreground window, `Release` => tray/background
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - `Debug` launches foreground by default ✅
  - `Release` launches tray by default ✅
  - the launch arg consistently forces tray in both build configs ✅

#### 1.2 Define "auto-start launch behavior"

- **Files:** `App.xaml.cs`
- **Status:** Completed.
- **Implemented:** Tray-first startup behavior integrated:
  - When launched from startup/login:
    - does not show the main window
    - initializes tray icon immediately
    - begins startup work in background
    - exposes UI only via tray click/menu
  - Startup entry argument forces tray-first behavior
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - app starts silently in tray after login ✅
  - no disruptive main window popup at boot ✅

#### 1.3 Foreground the existing instance

- **Files:** `App.xaml.cs`
- **Status:** Completed.
- **Implemented:** Single-instance mutex enforcement with instance activation signal:
  - On second launch:
    - checks for existing instance via named mutex
    - signals the existing instance to show/activate the main window
    - exits the second process
  - Uses mutex + `WM_SHOWWINDOW` message for IPC
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - double launching the app restores the first instance instead of just showing a message ✅

---

## Phase 2 - Add persistent logging

### Goal

Use structured, persistent file logging for startup/runtime/shutdown diagnostics.

### Work items

#### 2.1 Wire up structured logging

- **Files:** `App.xaml.cs`, `KeyPulse.csproj`
- **Status:** Completed.
- **Implemented:** Serilog startup initialization with file sink under `%AppData%\KeyPulse\Logs\`
- **Recommended log files:**
  - rolling daily logs
  - retained for a limited number of days/files
- **Added package:**
  - `Serilog.Sinks.File`
- **Current log level policy:**
  - `Debug` build: `Debug+`
  - `Release` build: `Information+`
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - app writes logs on startup, shutdown, and failures ✅
  - logs persist after app restarts ✅
  - `Release` no longer emits `Debug` events by default ✅

#### 2.2 Replace `Debug.WriteLine`

- **Files:**
  - `App.xaml.cs`
  - `Services/DataService.cs`
  - `Services/UsbMonitorService.cs`
  - `Services/RawInputService.cs`
  - `Helpers/HeartbeatFile.cs`
  - `Helpers/DeviceNameLookup.cs`
- **Status:** Completed.
- **Implemented:** Replaced `Debug.WriteLine(...)` with structured logging calls:
  - information
  - warning
  - error
- **Minimum events to log:**
  - startup/shutdown
  - tray init
  - WMI watcher start/stop
  - raw input registration success/failure
  - database migration/rebuild/recovery
  - duplicate event suppression
  - exceptions in service flows
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - no critical operational diagnostics depend solely on debugger output ✅
  - no `Debug.WriteLine` usage remains in target Phase 2 files ✅

---

## Phase 3 - Harden shutdown, crash recovery, and long-running behavior

### Goal

Make the app reliable as an always-running background utility.

### Work items

#### 3.1 Audit shutdown paths

- **Files:** `App.xaml.cs`, `Services/UsbMonitorService.cs`, `Services/RawInputService.cs`
- **Status:** Completed.
- **Implemented:** All shutdown paths verified and enhanced:
  - manual exit from tray
  - Windows logoff
  - Windows shutdown
  - unhandled exception
  - hidden-window/tray-only mode
- **Ensured:**
  - `RawInputService.Dispose()` flushes pending activity safely with error handling
  - `UsbMonitorService.Dispose()` stops watchers cleanly with granular error handling for each step
  - tray icon is disposed safely
  - heartbeat file is cleared with error handling
  - each dispose step is logged with duration
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - normal exit leaves DB/event state consistent ✅
  - no orphan tray icons after app exit ✅

#### 3.2 Improve crash recovery observability

- **Files:** `Services/DataService.cs`
- **Status:** Completed.
- **Implemented:** Enhanced crash recovery logging to include:
  - detection of unclean shutdown with timestamp
  - count of backfilled `ConnectionEnded` events
  - list of affected device IDs
  - recovery duration in milliseconds
  - warning-level logging on detection
- **Example log output:**
  - `"RecoverFromCrash detected unclean shutdown; last AppStarted at {OrphanedSessionStart}"`
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - crash recovery behavior is diagnosable from logs ✅

#### 3.3 Add retry/degraded-mode startup

- **Files:** `App.xaml.cs`, `Services/UsbMonitorService.cs`, `Services/RawInputService.cs`
- **Status:** Completed.
- **Implemented:** Graceful degradation on subsystem startup failures:
  - **UsbMonitorService.StartAsync()**: If `SetCurrentDevicesFromSystem()` fails, app continues with known devices and
    logs warning; if WMI monitoring fails to start, app runs without live device events but continues
  - **RawInputService.Start()**: If message window creation or device registration fails, app continues without
    real-time activity tracking but lifecycle tracking remains
  - **App.xaml.cs**: Wraps both service startups in try/catch blocks; shows user-facing warning balloons (in tray) or
    dialog boxes (windowed mode) if critical failures occur
- **User-facing notifications:**
  - Tray balloon warning: "Device monitoring failed to start completely. Some features may be unavailable..."
  - Dialog warning: "Activity tracking failed to start. The app will continue running but activity data may not be
    collected..."
- **Logging:**
  - Each subsystem failure is logged at ERROR level with full diagnostics
  - Degraded mode is explicitly noted in logs
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - single subsystem failure does not kill the entire app session ✅
  - app always comes up in tray/window even if WMI or Raw Input fails ✅
  - users are notified of degraded functionality ✅

#### 3.4 Centralize configuration constants

- **Files:** `Configuration/AppConstants.cs` (new)
- **Status:** Completed.
- **Why:** Magic strings scattered through code are hard to maintain, error-prone to refactor, and make behavior
  non-obvious.
- **Implemented:** Centralized all configuration constants under `AppConstants` with logical grouping:
  - `App` group: app name, startup argument, activation event suffix
  - `Paths` group: directory/file names for logs, settings, database, heartbeat
  - `Logging` group: file retention policy, UI timeout durations
  - `Registry` group: registry key paths, property names, GUIDs for device metadata lookup
  - `UsbMonitoring` group: WMI polling intervals, signal aggregation windows, service names, device names
- **Usage:** All services and helpers reference `AppConstants.*` instead of inline strings
- **Benefits:**
  - single source of truth for tunable/deployment-critical values
  - easier to review what's configurable
  - audit trail for changing behavior
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - no magic strings in core services ✅
  - constants are grouped logically by domain ✅

---

## Phase 4 - Implement "Launch on Login"

### Goal

Support reliable auto-start at user logon.

### Work items

#### 4.1 Add an autostart abstraction

- **Files:** new file (e.g. `Services/StartupRegistrationService.cs`), optional settings model/viewmodel files
- **Status:** Completed.
- **Implemented:** Added startup registration support via `StartupRegistrationService` with methods:
  - `bool IsEnabled()`
  - `void Enable()`
  - `void Disable()`
- **Implementation details:**
  - uses per-user registry key `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`
  - startup command is the quoted current executable path
  - always includes `--tray` for login launch behavior
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - app can enable/disable launch-on-login for current user ✅

#### 4.2 Add a setting for "Launch on Login"

- **Files:** settings model/service (new), relevant view/viewmodel if exposed in UI
- **Status:** Completed.
- **Implemented:** Added persisted settings through `AppUserSettings` + `AppSettingsService` under
  `%AppData%\KeyPulse\settings.json`.
- **Persisted preferences:**
  - launch at login
- **UX wiring:** Added synced tray + settings-tab toggle behavior with shared settings updates in `App.xaml.cs`.
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - user can toggle startup behavior without editing config manually ✅

#### 4.3 Support explicit startup arguments

- **Files:** `App.xaml.cs`
- **Status:** Completed.
- **Implemented:** Startup argument support is active in `ResolveRunInBackground()` / `ShouldForceTrayFromArgs()`:
  - `--tray`
- **Use:** startup registration writes it for login launches.
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - auto-start can reliably start hidden/tray mode regardless of default app launch behavior ✅

---

## Phase 5 - Fix release build and packaging basics

### Goal

Make release output suitable for actual deployment.

### Work items

#### 5.1 Correct release configuration

- **Files:** `KeyPulse.csproj`
- **Status:** Completed.
- **Implemented:** Hardened `Release|AnyCPU` build configuration with explicit production-oriented settings:
  - `DefineConstants=TRACE` so Release excludes `DEBUG`
  - `Optimize=True`
  - `Deterministic=True`
  - `DebugType=portable`
  - `DebugSymbols=True`
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - Release build is truly production-oriented ✅

#### 5.2 Decide install/publish strategy

- **Files:** likely new installer/project files (not yet present)
- **Status:** Completed.
- **Implemented:** Chosen **installer-based packaging (Inno Setup)** and added installer script (`installer/KeyPulse.iss`) with:
  - install directory under Program Files
  - Start Menu shortcut and optional desktop shortcut
  - optional post-install launch
  - packaging output under `installer/output/` (ignored in `.gitignore`)
- **Recommended options:**
  - **Inno Setup / WiX** (best fit for current app style)
    - install app under user or program files
    - optionally create startup entry
    - create Start Menu shortcut
    - uninstall cleanly
    - preserve `%AppData%\KeyPulse\keypulse-data.db`
  - **MSIX**
    - possible, but validate tray/raw-input/WMI compatibility and startup behavior before committing
- **Recommendation:** Start with Inno Setup or WiX for fastest path.
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - clean install ✅
  - clean uninstall ✅

#### 5.3 Preserve user data across upgrades

- **Files:** installer config, possibly migration/recovery docs
- **Status:** Completed.
- **Implemented:** Inno Setup uninstall flow prompts user whether to remove `%AppData%\KeyPulse` data; default
  behavior preserves user data unless explicitly confirmed. Upgrade installs over existing install without data loss.
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - upgrading app keeps history and settings intact ✅

---

## Phase 6 - Settings, UX, and supportability

### Goal

Make the app manageable for real users.

### Work items

#### 6.1 Add a settings surface

- **Files:** likely new settings view/viewmodel; maybe `MainWindow.xaml` / settings page
- **Status:** Completed.
- **Settings to add:**
  - Launch on Login
  - Open logs folder
  - Support-oriented log viewer (dropdown + content display)
- **Implemented:**
  - Added startup setting for `Launch on Login`
  - Added `Open Logs Folder` action in Settings
  - Added in-app log viewer with log-file dropdown, refresh, copy, and read-only log content display
  - Log panel is hidden by default behind `Show Logs`, with quick Fatal/Error counts on the toggle
  - Filter options show per-level counts (`All`, `Fatal`, `Error`, `Warning`, `Information`, `Debug`)
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - key operational settings are discoverable in UI ✅

#### 6.2 Improve tray UX

- **Files:** `App.xaml.cs`
- **Status:** Completed.
- **Add tray menu items:**
  - Open
  - Launch on Login (toggle)
  - Exit
- **Implemented:** Retained a minimal tray menu for frequent actions; logs access remains in Settings to keep tray UX
  focused.
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - most common tray actions are available without opening main UI ✅

#### 6.3 Add user-visible startup failure messaging

- **Files:** `App.xaml.cs`
- **Status:** Completed.
- **Implement:** If startup is partially broken:
  - show a single tray balloon / dialog / notification
  - direct user to logs
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - failures are visible without attaching a debugger ✅

---

## Phase 7 - Reduce operational risk

### Goal

Lower support burden and avoid preventable failures.

### Work items

#### 7.1 Replace or reduce PowerShell dependency

- **Files:** `Helpers/DeviceNameLookup.cs`, `Helpers/PowerShellScripts.cs`
- **Status:** Completed.
- **Why:** PowerShell in background apps can be slower, policy-restricted, and less reliable in enterprise environments.
- **Implement:** Prefer direct Windows-native lookup if feasible (registry/SetupAPI/WMI without spawning PowerShell).
- **Implemented:** `DeviceNameLookup.GetDeviceName()` now:
  - attempts SetupAPI + cfgmgr32 P/Invoke first (native Windows calls, no PowerShell)
  - falls back to `PowershellScripts.GetDeviceName()` only if SetupAPI fails
  - refactored to eliminate internal PowerShell spawning logic (now delegates fallback to centralized
    `PowershellScripts` helper)
  - logs which resolution method succeeded for diagnostics
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - device-name lookup never launches PowerShell in the normal/happy path ✅
  - PowerShell is relegated to fallback-only for edge cases ✅

#### 7.2 Add DB backup / migration safety plan

- **Files:** `Services/DataService.cs`, `Configuration/AppConstants.cs`
- **Status:** Completed.
- **Implemented:** `DataService.InitializeDatabase()` now performs migration safety checks:
  - logs applied/pending migration counts and pending migration names
  - creates timestamped pre-migration backups under `%AppData%\KeyPulse\DbBackups\`
  - includes SQLite sidecar files (`-wal`, `-shm`) when present
  - wraps migration startup with explicit error logging and fail-fast rethrow
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - pre-migration recovery point is generated before schema updates ✅
  - migration failures are diagnosable from logs ✅

#### 7.3 Add code signing

- **Files:** `scripts/Sign-ReleaseArtifacts.ps1`, release/pipeline config
- **Status:** Deferred.
- **Deferred rationale:** Scripted signing support is in place, but certificate procurement and CI secret onboarding are postponed for small trusted distribution.
- **Implemented:** Added signing automation script for release artifacts:
  - signs both app executable and installer artifacts
  - supports either certificate thumbprint (`KEYPULSE_SIGN_CERT_THUMBPRINT`) or PFX (`KEYPULSE_SIGN_PFX_PATH` + `KEYPULSE_SIGN_PFX_PASSWORD`)
  - enforces SHA-256 file digest + RFC3161 timestamping
  - fails with explicit guidance if signing configuration is missing
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - executable and installer signing can be executed in one scripted step
  - release process is ready for CI secret wiring without code changes

---

## Phase 8 - Updates and release operations

### Goal

Support long-term maintenance.

### Work items

#### 8.1 Add versioned release process

- **Files:** `KeyPulse.csproj`, `installer/KeyPulse.iss`, `.github/workflows/release.yml`, `docs/RELEASE_PROCESS.md`, `docs/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`
- **Status:** Completed.
- **Implemented:** Defined reproducible release operations with semantic versioning and GitHub Actions automation:
  - semantic version source-of-truth set in `KeyPulse.csproj` (`Version`, `FileVersion`) and mirrored in `installer/KeyPulse.iss`
  - pushing a `v*.*.*` tag triggers GitHub Actions: validate versions → publish → build installer → create GitHub Release with artifact
  - added release runbook and checklist docs under `docs/`
  - added `CHANGELOG.md` for release-note tracking
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - reproducible release process ✅

#### 8.2 Add auto-update path (optional but recommended)

- **Files:** `README.md`, `docs/RELEASE_PROCESS.md`, `docs/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md`
- **Status:** Completed.
- **Implemented:** Adopted installer-driven updates:
  - documented update flow: run latest installer over existing install (no uninstall-first)
  - standardized release guidance for publishing/versioning installer artifacts
  - included upgrade validation in release checklist
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - users can upgrade without manual uninstall/reinstall ✅
