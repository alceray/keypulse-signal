# KeyPulse Signal Release Process

This document is the canonical release runbook (commands and behavior details). Use
`docs/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md` as the execution checklist.

## Versioning Scheme

The git tag is the single source of truth for release versions. The workflow automatically injects versions from the tag into the build — no manual version bumps in
`KeyPulse.csproj` or `installer/KeyPulse.iss` are required for GitHub releases.

- `KeyPulse.csproj` `Version` and `FileVersion` are overridden at publish time via MSBuild `/p:` args
- `installer/KeyPulse.iss` `AppVersion` is overridden at compile time via `/DAppVersion=...`

`KeyPulse.csproj` may keep a developer-default version (e.g.
`1.2.0`) for local builds. It does not need to be bumped before tagging, though keeping it in sync
with the latest tag is good hygiene.

## Automated Release (GitHub Actions)

Pushing a version tag triggers the release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`):

1. Extracts the version from the pushed tag (e.g. `v1.2.0` → `1.2.0`)
2. Publishes the app with the tag version injected (`/p:Version=...`, `/p:FileVersion=...`)
3. Compiles the installer with the tag version injected (`/DAppVersion=...`)
4. Extracts the matching `## [<version>]` section from `CHANGELOG.md` (via the workflow's
   `Extract release notes from changelog` step) and creates a GitHub Release with the installer
   attached and that section as the release notes — not the whole file

## How to Cut a Release

1. Choose the next version (semver): bump the **minor** when the release adds features
   (an `### Added` section), the **patch** for fixes-only releases, and the **major** for breaking
   changes. The changelog's section headings are the quickest tell — any `### Added` entries mean a
   minor, not a patch.
2. Add the matching `## [<version>] - <date>` entry to `CHANGELOG.md`, and bump `Version` /
   `FileVersion` in `KeyPulse.csproj` to keep the developer-default in sync (optional but tidy).
3. Commit and push.
4. Push a version tag with the helper script:
   ```powershell
   .\scripts\New-Release.ps1 -Version "1.2.0"
   ```
5. The script validates a clean working tree and prevents duplicate tags.
6. GitHub Actions builds and publishes the release automatically.

Manual fallback:

```powershell
git tag v1.2.0
git push origin v1.2.0
```

## Manual Build (local testing)

```powershell
.\scripts\Build-Release.ps1 -Version "1.2.0"
```

Omit `-Version` to use the default version in `KeyPulse.csproj`.

## Update Strategy

KeyPulse Signal updates are installer-driven:

1. Download the latest installer from the GitHub Release.
2. Run it over the existing install — do not uninstall first.
3. Installer upgrades in place (`AppId` is unchanged).
4. User data in `%AppData%\KeyPulse Signal` is preserved unless explicitly removed during uninstall.

## Verification

- App launches and reports expected version.
- Upgrade preserves:
  - `%AppData%\KeyPulse Signal\keypulse-data.db`
  - `%AppData%\KeyPulse Signal\settings.json`
  - `%AppData%\KeyPulse Signal\Logs\`
- Installer filename includes the release version.
