# KeyPulse Signal

**Know exactly which board or mouse you picked up today, and how hard you pushed it.**

KeyPulse Signal is a lightweight Windows desktop app built for keyboard and mouse enthusiasts who frequently rotate gear and want real data behind their daily drivers. It silently tracks every USB connection, counts every keystroke and click per device, and gives you a per-device breakdown by day. You always know which board carried the most load this week, or how long that new endgame actually spent on the desk.

## What It Tracks

- **Connection history**: when each external USB device was plugged in, for how long, and how many sessions.
- **Input activity**: per-device keystrokes, mouse clicks, and movement time captured silently in the background.
- **Daily summaries**: a calendar view showing which devices were active on any given day, with session counts, active time as a share of connected time, and an hour-by-hour activity breakdown that highlights your peak hour.
- **Live device state**: a device list showing what's connected right now, with real-time input counters ticking up as you type, alongside per-device lifetime totals like time connected and days connected.

## Features

- Automatically detects supported USB keyboards and mice as they come and go.
- Counts keystrokes, mouse clicks, and active mouse-movement seconds per device.
- Keeps connection history, sessions, daily totals, and lifetime stats in a local SQLite database.
- Includes a dashboard, day-by-day calendar, and live device list.
- Runs in the system tray, supports session-only tracking pause, and can hide devices from presentation views without stopping their tracking.
- Keeps history across restarts and recovers unfinished sessions after an unexpected shutdown.

## Install and run

Download the latest installer from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/alceray/keypulse-signal/releases). KeyPulse Signal runs on Windows 10 version 1607 or later. Windows 11 is recommended.

Framework-dependent builds require the [.NET 8 Desktop Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0). External USB keyboards and mice are supported. Built-in laptop keyboards and trackpads are not tracked.

## Develop locally

### Prerequisites

- Windows 10 or 11
- .NET 8 SDK
- Visual Studio 2022 or JetBrains Rider with WPF support

```powershell
dotnet restore
dotnet build -c Debug
dotnet run -c Debug
```

To test release behavior locally:

```powershell
dotnet run -c Release
```

Debug builds open a normal window. Release builds start in the system tray. Add `--tray` to force tray mode for any launch.

## Your data

Everything stays on your machine in SQLite.

KeyPulse records activity totals, not the content of your input. It does not record which keys you press, the text you type, mouse coordinates, or mouse paths.

| Build | Database location |
| --- | --- |
| Release | `%AppData%\KeyPulse Signal\keypulse-data.db` |
| Debug | `%AppData%\KeyPulse Signal\Test\keypulse-data.db` |

The database stores device snapshots, connection events, minute-level activity snapshots, and daily aggregates. Retention settings only prune old minute-level detail. Your daily history and connection totals stay intact.

## How it works

KeyPulse uses Windows WMI to watch USB connection changes and Windows Raw Input to attribute typing and mouse activity to individual devices. EF Core and SQLite handle persistence. The WPF interface is backed by a small set of singleton services for monitoring, capture, timing, daily aggregation, retention, and application settings.

The project targets `.NET 8` and uses WPF, EF Core 9, SQLite, Serilog, OxyPlot, and `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection`.

## Technical architecture

The app keeps device capture, persistence, and presentation separate. Long-lived services are registered as singletons, while tab view-models are created when their views are opened.

| Component | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `AppTimerService` | Owns the shared UI-thread timers for live updates, dashboard refreshes, daily work, and minute projections. |
| `UsbMonitorService` | Watches WMI device arrival and removal events, filters for supported HID devices, combines bursty interface events into one connection, and maintains the UI-bound device snapshot. |
| `RawInputService` | Runs a hidden `WM_INPUT` listener with `RIDEV_INPUTSINK`, captures input even in tray mode, and collects per-device minute buckets. |
| `DataService` | Applies migrations, enables SQLite WAL mode, owns database operations, recovers from unclean shutdowns, and rebuilds device snapshots on startup. |
| `DailyStatsService` | Projects lifecycle events and closed activity minutes into durable per-device, per-day aggregates. It performs a one-time historical backfill, then reconciles missing aggregate rows on later starts. |
| `DataRetentionService` | Prunes old minute-level snapshots and projection checkpoints only after they have been reflected in daily aggregates. |

### Data flow

1. On startup, the app creates its service container, migrates the database, recovers unfinished sessions, and rebuilds the fast device snapshot.
2. `UsbMonitorService` scans currently connected devices, writes lifecycle events, then starts WMI watchers for later changes.
3. `RawInputService` maps Raw Input handles to device IDs and records keys, clicks, and movement-active seconds in one-minute buckets.
4. Closed buckets are saved as activity snapshots and projected into daily totals. The dashboard and calendar read those totals, while live input deltas keep today's UI current between flushes.
5. On a normal exit, the app flushes the partial minute and closes device and app sessions. Crash recovery covers the cases where Windows or a process termination prevents that cleanup.

### Persistence model

| Table | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `Devices` | Mutable device snapshot for fast UI reads, including name, type, visibility preference, and lifetime totals. |
| `DeviceEvents` | Append-only app and device lifecycle log. This is the source of truth for connection history. |
| `ActivitySnapshots` | Immutable per-device minute buckets for keystrokes, clicks, and mouse-movement seconds. |
| `DailyDeviceStats` | Durable per-device daily aggregates for connections and input activity. It keeps calendar history available after minute-level retention pruning. |
| `ActivityProjections` | Per-minute checkpoints that ensure a snapshot is projected into daily totals exactly once. |

Hidden devices are a presentation setting only. They continue to be monitored, captured, stored, and aggregated, but are filtered out of dashboard and calendar queries.

## Troubleshooting

- A second launch restores the existing app window. This is expected.
- If a build says the executable is locked, close the running KeyPulse instance and build again.
- If a device appears as `Unknown Device`, Windows did not provide a usable friendly name. You can rename it in the app.
- The Troubleshooting page includes searchable logs when you need a closer look.
