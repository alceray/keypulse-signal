# AGENTS.md: KeyPulse Architecture Guide

## Quick Overview

**KeyPulse** is a .NET 8 WPF desktop app for tracking USB keyboard and mouse connections on Windows and recording
per-device input activity. It uses WMI event watchers for device arrival/removal, Windows Raw Input for per-device
keyboard/mouse activity, and SQLite+EF Core for persistence. The app is single-instance and supports optional
tray/background mode.

**Key Tech Stack**: WPF, EF Core 9, SQLite, System.Management (WMI), Windows Raw Input (`WM_INPUT`), Dependency
Injection

## Architecture & Data Flow

### Major Components

1. **AppTimerService** (Singleton)
    - Owns all periodic UI-thread timers: 1 second, 30 seconds (dashboard refresh), 1 minute (stats projection), and daily (update check, retention prune)
    - Broadcasts `SecondTick`, `ThirtySecondTick`, `MinuteTick`, and `DailyTick` events to subscriber services and view-models
    - Keeps transient view-models lean by centralizing timer ownership
    - Allows timers to persist across view lifecycle changes (e.g., tab switches)
    - See: `Services/AppTimerService.cs`

2. **UsbMonitorService** (Singleton)
    - Monitors USB device insertion/removal via WMI `__InstanceCreationEvent` and `__InstanceDeletionEvent`
    - Maintains `DeviceList` and `DeviceEventList` as `ObservableCollection<T>` instances for UI binding
    - Screens for HID keyboard/mouse devices only (`kbdhid`, `mouhid` services)
    - Aggregates bursty insert callbacks into one logical `Connected` event per device burst
    - Writes app/device lifecycle events and keeps the in-memory device snapshot in sync
    - Owns the heartbeat timer for crash recovery (separate from UI timers)
    - See: `Services/UsbMonitorService.cs`

3. **RawInputService** (Singleton)
    - Registers hidden `WM_INPUT` listeners using `RIDEV_INPUTSINK`, so activity is captured even in tray/background
      mode
    - Maps raw input handles back to KeyPulse `DeviceId` values
    - Tracks per-device keystrokes, mouse clicks, and mouse-movement-active seconds in one-minute buckets
    - Flushes completed minute buckets to `ActivitySnapshots` every minute and flushes the current partial minute on
      shutdown
    - Raises `ActivityStateChanged` (per-device hold-state) so the UI can highlight currently active devices
    - Raises `InputDeltaIncremented` with per-device `(KeystrokeDelta, MouseClickDelta, MouseMovementDelta)` so live views (e.g. calendar today-overlay) can tick without waiting for the minute flush
    - See: `Services/RawInputService.cs`

4. **DataService** (Singleton)
    - Single source for all database operations
    - Runs migrations and enables SQLite WAL mode on startup
    - Crash recovery: detects unclean shutdowns and writes missing `AppEnded`/`ConnectionEnded` events
    - Rebuilds persisted device connection-duration snapshots from the event log on startup
    - Persists and queries minute-level `ActivitySnapshot` rows
    - See: `Services/DataService.cs`

5. **DailyStatsService** (Singleton)
    - Maintains `DailyDeviceStats` table from two write-through sources:
        - **DeviceEvents**: on every closing lifecycle event, recomputes that day's `SessionCount`, `ConnectionSeconds`, `LongestSessionSeconds` with a full non-cumulative replay of the day's events
        - **ActivitySnapshots**: minute-delayed projector flushes closed minute buckets to `Keystrokes`, `MouseClicks`, `MouseMovementSeconds`, `ActiveMinutes`, and `HourlyInputCount` (a `long[24]` of combined input keyed by local clock-hour)
    - `RecomputeDailyDeviceStatsForRange(from, to)` provides an idempotent full rebuild for any date range
    - `RunStartupRebuild()` (called on a background thread from `App.OnStartup`) is the startup entry point:
        - **First run only** (when the `DailyStatsFullBackfillAt` `AppMeta` marker is absent): runs a one-time full historical backfill from the earliest source day through today via `RebuildAllHistory(...)`, chunked month-by-month so memory stays bounded, then writes the marker
        - **Every later run**: runs `ReconcileDriftedDays(today)` — a cheap, non-destructive integrity pass over the current month that heals only `(DeviceId, day)` rows MISSING from `DailyDeviceStats` despite a closing event or activity snapshot existing (the one drift the write-through / projector paths cannot self-heal), logging any discrepancy
    - No recurring blind rebuild: ongoing data is kept current by write-through (connection) + the live projector (activity), which drains all unprojected closed minutes on startup regardless of age
    - All `DailyDeviceStats` mutations (range recompute, live projector, connection write-through) serialize on a single in-process gate so concurrent writers can't collide on the unique `ActivityProjections(DeviceId, Minute)` / `DailyDeviceStats(Day, DeviceId)` indexes
    - See: `Services/DailyStatsService.cs`

6. **DataRetentionService** (Singleton)
    - Applies the user's `ActivityRetentionMonths` setting (0 = keep forever) by pruning `ActivitySnapshots` and `ActivityProjections` older than the cutoff day; `DailyDeviceStats` and `DeviceEvents` are always kept, so calendar history and connection totals survive pruning
    - Invariants: never prunes before the `DailyStatsFullBackfillAt` marker exists (a later first-run backfill would recompute old days from pruned sources and zero them); drains `ProjectClosedActivityMinutes()` before deleting; within each batch window deletes snapshots **before** their projection checkpoints (orphan checkpoints are harmless, orphan snapshots would be re-projected and double-counted)
    - Deletes in week-sized chunks (short write transactions under WAL); compacts via `VACUUM` only after large prunes
    - Triggers: chained after `RunStartupRebuild()` on the startup background task, on `DailyTick`, and when the retention setting is tightened
    - See: `Services/DataRetentionService.cs`

7. **ApplicationDbContext** (`DbContext`)
    - Five EF tables: `Devices`, `DeviceEvents`, `ActivitySnapshots`, `DailyDeviceStats`, and `ActivityProjections` (per-minute projection checkpoints), plus the raw `AppMeta` key/value table created lazily outside EF
    - Database stored at `%AppData%\KeyPulse Signal\keypulse-data.db` in Release and `%AppData%\KeyPulse Signal\Test\keypulse-data.db` in Debug/testing builds (folder name = `AppConstants.App.ProductName`, the assembly name)
    - Unique constraint on `DeviceEvents(DeviceId, EventTime, EventType)` prevents duplicate lifecycle events
    - Unique constraint on `ActivitySnapshots(DeviceId, Minute)` prevents duplicate minute buckets
    - See: `Data/ApplicationDbContext.cs`

### Data Persistence Model

- **DeviceEvents** = immutable, append-only log of app/device lifecycle transitions (source of truth for connection
  history)
- **Devices** = mutable, fast-read snapshot used by the UI (`DeviceName`, `DeviceType`, `LastConnectedAt`, stored
  `TotalConnectionSeconds`, `TotalInputCount`, `IsHiddenFromDisplay`)
- **ActivitySnapshots** = immutable minute buckets storing `Keystrokes`, `MouseClicks`, and `MouseMovementSeconds`
- **DailyDeviceStats** = mutable per-day per-device aggregates (`SessionCount`, `ConnectionSeconds`, `Keystrokes`, activity stats etc.) derived from DeviceEvents and ActivitySnapshots; backfilled in full once on first startup, then kept current by write-through + the live projector with a per-startup drift-recovery pass
- **ActivityProjections** = per-(device, minute) checkpoints recording which snapshots were projected into `DailyDeviceStats`; grows in lockstep with `ActivitySnapshots` and is pruned together with it by retention
- Retention prunes only the two per-minute tables; once pruned, `DailyDeviceStats` is the sole surviving record of those days. Pruning has no visible UI effect: the dashboard chart serves hour-aligned bucket tiers (1 Month and longer) from `HourlyInputCount` aggregates via `DashboardHourlyActivityAdapter`, and the raw-minute tiers (1 Day / 1 Week) only ever read windows far newer than the minimum retention cutoff
- Updates flow in two directions:
    - lifecycle changes append to `DeviceEvents` and update the corresponding `Device` snapshot
    - raw input activity accumulates in memory, then flushes to `ActivitySnapshots`

### Startup Sequence (See `App.OnStartup`, `UsbMonitorService`, and `RawInputService`)

1. Register unhandled-exception cleanup hooks.
2. Mutex check (single-instance enforcement). If another instance exists, signal it to restore/focus and exit.
3. Resolve startup mode from build configuration (Debug foreground, Release tray), with launch args able to force tray
   mode.
4. Build the DI container.
5. Resolve `UsbMonitorService` (which also resolves `DataService`). During construction:
    - database migrations run,
    - SQLite WAL mode is enabled,
    - `DataService.RecoverFromCrash()` backfills missing close events if needed,
    - `DataService.RebuildDeviceSnapshots()` recomputes persisted `TotalConnectionSeconds` and `TotalInputCount` and clears stale `SessionStartedAt`,
    - historical `Devices` / `DeviceEvents` are loaded,
    - the heartbeat timer starts.
6. `DailyStatsService.RunStartupRebuild()` and `DataRetentionService.RunStartupPrune()` run chained on one background
   task (prune strictly after rebuild, so a first-run backfill never sees pruned sources).
7. Show the main window immediately or initialize the tray icon, depending on background mode.
8. Await `UsbMonitorService.StartAsync()`:
    - `SetCurrentDevicesFromSystem()` writes `AppStarted`, snapshots currently connected HID devices, and emits
      `ConnectionStarted` for each one,
    - then WMI watchers are started for live insert/remove events.
9. Resolve `RawInputService` and call `Start()` to create the hidden message-only window and begin receiving `WM_INPUT`.

### Shutdown / Disposal Ownership

- During normal application exit, DI owns disposal of singleton services via `ServiceProvider.Dispose()`.
- Singleton `Dispose()` methods are idempotent and may still be called from crash/unhandled-exception cleanup paths.
- Duplicate dispose attempts should return immediately and log a `Debug` message rather than performing cleanup twice.

## Critical Patterns & Conventions

### Event Types & Lifecycle

Event types are defined in `Models/DeviceEvent.cs` and categorized by `EventTypeExtensions`:

- **Opening**: `ConnectionStarted`, `Connected`
- **Closing**: `ConnectionEnded`, `Disconnected`
- **App-level**: `AppStarted`, `AppEnded`

Device state management is centralized in `UsbMonitorService.AddDeviceEvent()`:

- opening events set `SessionStartedAt`
- closing events commit elapsed time into stored connection duration and clear `SessionStartedAt`
- app-level events are logged without touching per-device state

### Device Identification

- **Format**: `USB\VID_xxxx&PID_xxxx` (parsed from WMI `DeviceID`)
- **Classification**: `UsbDeviceClassifier.GetInterfaceSignal()` probes WMI for `Service`, `ClassGuid`, `PNPClass`
- **Type Resolution**: Multiple HID interfaces expected per device; wait for ≥2 signals before determining type (
  keyboard vs. mouse)

### Property Binding & Threading

- **ObservableObject** base class (in `Helpers/`) wraps `INotifyPropertyChanged`
- Automatically marshals property changes to UI thread via `Application.Current.Dispatcher`
- See `Models/Device.cs` for example: `SessionStartedAt` triggers dependent notifications for `IsConnected` and
  `TotalConnectionSeconds`
- **Important**: `IsConnected` and `IsActive` are different concepts:
    - `IsConnected` means the device currently has an open connection session (`SessionStartedAt.HasValue`)
    - `IsActive` is a transient raw-input hold-state flag used to highlight devices while keys/buttons are currently
      held
    - `IsHiddenFromDisplay` is a persisted user preference that hides a device from **presentation only** (see "Device Display Visibility" below); it never gates capture, event logging, or stat projection
- **Important**: `TotalConnectionSeconds` is computed while connected; its getter returns the stored seconds plus elapsed time since
  `SessionStartedAt`

### Raw Input Activity Semantics

- `RawInputService` creates one in-memory bucket per `(DeviceId, Minute)`.
- **Keyboard**: every key-down increments `Keystrokes`; key-up only updates hold state.
- **Mouse buttons**: every button-down increments `MouseClicks`; button-up only updates hold state.
- **Mouse movement**: movement is recorded as a set of second-of-minute values, then persisted as `MouseMovementSeconds` (
  0–60).
- Completed minutes flush every 60 seconds; dispose/shutdown flushes the current partial minute as well.

### Dashboard Behavior (Connection Duration + Activity)

- **Dashboard refresh**: `DashboardViewModel` subscribes to `AppTimerService.ThirtySecondTick` for periodic refresh
  (Dashboard is transient, so subscriptions are cleaned up when the view is destroyed and re-created when the tab is switched back)
- Dashboard top cards show current connected count and top-3 keyboard/mouse device connection-duration summaries.
- Time-range filter supports `1 Day`, `1 Week`, `1 Month`, `3 Months`, `1 Year`, and `All Time`.
- Activity chart bucket size is **derived from the selected range span**, not user-configurable (`DashboardActivityChartBuilder.ResolveBucketSize`): the finest size on a human-friendly ladder (1/2/5/10/15/30 min, 1/2/3/6/12 h, 1/2 d, 1/2 wk) that keeps the range under `MaxBucketCount` (400) points, so density stays roughly constant (e.g. 1 day → 5 min, 1 week → 30 min, 1 month → 2 h, 3 months → 6 h, 1 year → 1 day). The bucket is the data resolution: **zoom magnifies these points, it never re-aggregates to a finer bucket**. Each active run is plotted as a baseline-anchored polyline (straight segments through one raw per-bucket total at each bucket midpoint, no interpolation or moving-average smoothing) that breaks across inactive runs, so separate-time usage on different devices does not appear to overlap.
- Activity chart zeroes buckets where no app-running interval overlaps (`AppStarted`/`AppEnded` reconstruction).
- Activity chart series use:
    - keyboard = `Keystrokes`
    - mouse = `MouseClicks + MouseMovementSeconds`
- Devices flagged `IsHiddenFromDisplay` are excluded from cards, charts, and the underlying snapshot/event queries (see "Device Display Visibility").
- X-axis label format adapts by selected range:
    - `< 7 days`: `MM-dd HH:mm`
    - `>= 7 days and < 365 days`: `MM-dd`
    - `>= 365 days`: `yyyy-MM`
- Pie charts (`DashboardPieChartBuilder`) show connection-time **share** per device. Slices are colored by connection-time rank from `DashboardDeviceColorPalette` (cool palette = keyboards, warm = mice); devices past `MaxColoredDevicesPerType` (12) or below `OthersShareThreshold` (1%) collapse into a single grey "Others (n)" slice listing the grouped device names. Slices are ordered deterministically so equal values don't flip between refreshes.
- Pie hover tracking surfaces metadata (status, connection time, share, last seen/connected) and pushes it into a bound `DashboardHoverPreview` via OxyPlot tracker events.

### Calendar View Behavior

- **Data source**: `DailyStatsService.GetVisibleDailyDeviceStats()` (plain `DailyDeviceStat` rows, hidden devices excluded); `CalendarSummaryBuilder` (in `ViewModels/Calendar/`) maps rows + in-memory device metadata to tile summaries and detail rows, so the service never references presentation types.
- **Real-time overlay**: `CalendarViewModel` maintains a live in-memory input delta (`_todayLiveDeltaByDevice`) and connection overlay per device; `ApplyRealtimeTodayOverlay()` merges persisted + live state on every second tick and every `RawInputService.InputDeltaIncremented` event. There is **no** periodic DB-refresh timer — the calendar does not subscribe to `ThirtySecondTick`; the persisted baseline is re-read on month load, day selection, and day rollover only.
- **`CalendarDaySummary.IsToday`**: computed property (`Day == DateOnly.FromDateTime(DateTime.Now)`), never stale.
- **`CalendarDaySummary.IsSelected`**: UI-only flag toggled in-place via tile selection; never stored in DB.
- **Calendar DTOs** (`CalendarDaySummary`, `CalendarTileDevice`, `CalendarDeviceDetail`) use the `DeviceTypes` enum, not raw strings, and report connection time in seconds (`ConnectionSeconds`, `LongestSessionSeconds`).
- **Hourly activity bars**: `CalendarDeviceDetail.HourlyInputBars` is a 24-slot bar series built by `CalendarHourlyInputBarBuilder` from the day's `HourlyInputCount`; bar heights are normalized to the day's peak hour (`IsPeak` flags it). The same `IReadOnlyList` reference is cached per device across per-second overlay updates so WPF doesn't recreate the bar elements (keeps tooltips alive).
- **Arrow-key navigation**: `MoveSelectionByArrowAsync(±1)` moves the selection across data-bearing tiles, crossing month boundaries when needed; serialized through `_arrowNavigationGate` (a `SemaphoreSlim`) so rapid key-repeats don't interleave.
- Calendar detail panel uses responsive `DockPanel` rows so labels/values stay readable at any panel width.
- Devices flagged `IsHiddenFromDisplay` are excluded from summaries, tiles, and the detail panel; toggling visibility reloads the month (see "Device Display Visibility").

### Duplicate Detection

- WMI fires multiple insert events (~2-3) per physical USB connection
- `_cachedDevices` stores aggregated keyboard/mouse interface signals inside a short time window
- `_pendingCachedDeviceProcessing` ensures only one delayed aggregation callback runs per device burst, preventing a multi-callback race
- Only then is a single `Connected` event recorded
- `DeviceEvents` unique constraint prevents DB duplicates even if code fails

### Device Display Visibility

- `Device.IsHiddenFromDisplay` (persisted on `Devices`, default `false`, migration `AddDeviceDisplayVisibility`) is a **presentation-only** filter. Hidden devices still capture raw input, still append lifecycle events, and are still projected into `DailyDeviceStats` — only their *display* is suppressed.
- **Toggle path**: right-clicking a row in `DeviceListView` opens a context menu ("Hide/Show in Dashboard and Calendar"). `DeviceListViewModel.ToggleDeviceDisplayVisibilityCommand` calls `DataService.SetDeviceHiddenFromDisplay(deviceId, ...)`, and only flips the in-memory `Device.IsHiddenFromDisplay` if the DB write succeeds.
- **Unhide path**: the Settings page lists currently hidden devices (live, via `SettingsViewModel.HiddenDevices`) with an Unhide button. `UnhideDeviceCommand` runs the same `SetDeviceHiddenFromDisplay(deviceId, false)` write-then-flip, so both entry points share one code path and the shared in-memory `Device` propagates the change everywhere.
- **The device list itself does not hide hidden devices** — it shows a "Hidden" badge instead. Only the dashboard and calendar exclude them.
- **Where filtering happens**:
    - `DataService.GetDashboardDevices()` excludes hidden devices at the query.
    - `DashboardViewModel` derives a visible-device id set from that and filters snapshots + events before charting; it refreshes when any `Device.IsHiddenFromDisplay` changes. The activity chart's snapshot source is tiered by range: hour-aligned bucket tiers read `GetVisibleDailyDeviceStats` + `DashboardHourlyActivityAdapter` pseudo-snapshots, finer tiers read raw minute rows.
    - `DailyStatsService` excludes hidden devices from the earliest-day query and `GetVisibleDailyDeviceStats`. A day whose visible rows are empty yields `HasData = false` (via `CalendarSummaryBuilder`).
    - `CalendarViewModel` excludes hidden devices from the realtime overlay, tile summary, and detail panel, and subscribes to per-device `PropertyChanged` (managed via `DeviceList.CollectionChanged`) so toggling visibility reloads the current month.

## Workflows & Commands

### Database Migrations (via EF Core CLI in Developer PowerShell)

```powershell
# Add new migration from current model state
dotnet ef migrations add MyMigrationName

# Remove last unapplied migration
dotnet ef migrations remove

# Apply pending migrations to DB
dotnet ef database update

# Revert to specific migration target
dotnet ef database update SomeOlderMigrationName
```

### Configuration

- **AppConstants.App** structure consolidates application-level settings:
  - `ProductName` = "KeyPulse Signal" (from assembly)
  - `DefaultName` = "KeyPulse Signal" or "KeyPulse Signal (Test)" depending on Debug/Release build
  - `TrayArgument` = `--tray`
  - `ActivationEventSuffix` = `.ACTIVATE`
  - `RunKeyPath` = Windows registry path for startup entries
  - `TrayIconRelativePath` = relative path to the taskbar icon (`Assets\keypulse-signal-icon.ico`)
  - `StartupWarningBalloonTimeoutMs` = 5000 (milliseconds for startup warning balloon)
- **Build mode default**: Debug launches windowed; Release launches to tray/background
- **`LaunchOnLogin` default**: `false` in Debug, `true` in Release (controlled via `#if DEBUG` in `AppUserSettings`)
- **Launch args**: `--tray` forces tray/background startup for that process
- **Application icon**: Set via `<ApplicationIcon>` in `.csproj` for both window and taskbar display; also used for tray icon
- Tray icon created if background mode enabled; main window created on-demand or at startup

### Build & Run

- Target: `.net8.0-windows`, WPF enabled
- Debug builds auto-generate WPF XAML behind the scenes
- **Build may fail** if `KeyPulse Signal.exe` is locked — stop running instance first
- **Assets**: `Assets\keypulse-signal-icon.ico` (the `<ApplicationIcon>`) copied to build output

| `Configuration/` | `AppConstants` plus `AppColorPalette` — the single source of UI colors. `AppColorPalette.cs` holds the frozen `Brush`/`Color` palette (consumed from code and from XAML via `{x:Static config:AppColorPalette.X}`); reusable control styles live in `Views/Styles/AppStyles.xaml` (merged globally in `App.xaml`) and reference those brushes. The OxyPlot chart palette (`DashboardDeviceColorPalette`) is intentionally separate |
| `ViewModels/` | MVVM viewmodels for each UI view; `StatusMessageViewModelBase` provides shared status toast behavior. `Dashboard/` and `Calendar/` subfolders hold the chart/pie/color builders, DTOs, and per-view helpers extracted from the larger view-models |
| `Views/`      | XAML + code-behind for UI; `StatusMessagePanel` is a reusable status toast control; `SharedConverters.cs` holds shared `IValueConverter`s (e.g. `InverseBoolToVisibilityConverter`, `DurationSecondsConverter`); `Styles/AppStyles.xaml` holds the app-wide control styles |
| `Migrations/` | EF Core snapshot migrations (read-only; auto-generated)                                                          |

## Crash Recovery & Consistency

**Problem**: If app is force-killed (IDE stop, crash), devices may appear "stuck" as active in the DB.

**Solution** (`DataService.RecoverFromCrash`):

1. On startup, check if last app-lifecycle event was `AppStarted` (unmatched)
2. If so, retroactively add `AppEnded` and `ConnectionEnded` for orphaned devices
3. Event log stays consistent for future connection-duration calculations

**Snapshot Rebuild** (`DataService.RebuildDeviceSnapshots`):

- Recomputes persisted `TotalConnectionSeconds` from the event log (DeviceEvents are never pruned, so the event-pairing replay stays exact)
- Recomputes persisted `TotalInputCount` from `DailyDeviceStats` sums plus any snapshots without a projection checkpoint — exact in every DB state (pre-backfill, steady-state, and after retention pruned old snapshots)
- Clears runtime-only `SessionStartedAt` so devices do not appear connected after an unclean shutdown
- Called at startup after recovery

---

## Important Implementation Details

### Duplicate Event Prevention

- `DeviceInsertedEvent` accumulates keyboard/mouse signals until ≥2 are seen within a short timeframe
- Only emits one `Connected` event per physical device insertion
- DB unique constraint `(DeviceId, EventTime, EventType)` is secondary safeguard

### Current Session Connection Duration ("Session" vs. "Total")

- **SessionStartedAt**: Set when device becomes active (opening event), cleared when inactive
- **IsConnected**: Computed from `SessionStartedAt.HasValue`
- **IsActive**: Separate transient hold-state driven by `RawInputService.ActivityStateChanged`
- **TotalConnectionSeconds**: getter returns stored seconds + elapsed since SessionStartedAt (live tick while active)
- Avoids stale timing from unclean shutdown; current session always starts fresh

### ActivitySnapshots

- One row represents one device during one minute.
- `Keystrokes` counts key-down events.
- `MouseClicks` counts mouse button-down events.
- `MouseMovementSeconds` stores how many distinct seconds within the minute saw mouse movement.
- The current code persists snapshots, but the main UI primarily exposes live connection/activity state and total connection duration
  rather than a dedicated activity-history view.

### Device Name Resolution

- `DeviceNameLookup.GetDeviceName(deviceId)` first attempts native SetupAPI/cfgmgr32 lookup
- Falls back to `PowershellScripts.GetDeviceName(deviceId)` only if native lookup fails
- Falls back to `"Unknown Device"` if lookup fails
- Native lookup and PowerShell fallback paths log at `Debug`; lookup failures that throw log at `Warning`
- User can rename devices; changes saved immediately to DB

### Helper Logging Conventions

- Pure helpers such as `RelayCommand`, `AsyncRelayCommand`, and `ObservableObject` should stay log-free. `TimeFormatter` is log-free except `ToRelativeTime`, which logs an error when given a future timestamp.
- Log messages should state the condition in domain terms and must not expose internal code details (method or class names). For example, `ToRelativeTime`'s future-timestamp log reads `"Future timestamp received"`, not the method name.
- Helpers that touch the file system, PowerShell, SetupAPI/cfgmgr32, or crash-recovery inputs should log meaningful failures.
- `HeartbeatFile.Read()` should log `Debug` when no heartbeat file exists and `Warning` if the file exists but contains an invalid timestamp.
- `UsbDeviceClassifier.ResolveDeviceType()` logs `Warning` when the observed signal pattern does not match a known keyboard/mouse shape.

### TimeFormatter Helpers

- `ToLocalTime(DateTime)` — converts any `DateTime` to local time, treating `Unspecified` as UTC (matches SQLite reads).
- `ToLocalDay(DateTime)` — converts a UTC/unspecified timestamp to the local `DateOnly` day. Use this everywhere instead of `DateOnly.FromDateTime(ToLocalTime(...))`.
- `LocalDayToUtc(DateOnly)` — converts a local day to its UTC start boundary for inclusive range queries.
- `NormalizeUtcMinute(DateTime)` — converts to UTC then truncates to minute boundary; used by `DailyStatsService` projector.
- `TruncateToMinute(DateTime)` — truncates to minute while preserving `DateTimeKind`; used by `RawInputService` for local-time minute buckets. **Not interchangeable with `NormalizeUtcMinute`.**

### Status Message Pattern

- `StatusMessageViewModelBase` (`ViewModels/`) provides `StatusMessage`, `StatusVisibility`, and auto-clear timer behavior.
- ViewModels that need transient toast messages should inherit `StatusMessageViewModelBase` instead of duplicating these fields.
- `StatusMessagePanel` (`Views/`) is the reusable XAML control with `StatusMessage` and `StatusVisibility` dependency properties.
- Positioning (alignment, margin, grid row) is controlled by the host view — the panel itself is layout-agnostic.

### Dispatcher Safety in Services

Services that receive background callbacks (WMI events, `RawInputService` message pump) and update UI-bound collections must guard Dispatcher calls.
Use `ShutdownDispose.IsDispatcherUsable(dispatcher)` before any `Invoke`/`BeginInvoke`. Two shutdown scenarios require this:
1. **Normal shutdown**: `_disposed = true` is set at Dispose start; subsequent callbacks skip UI updates.
2. **Windows session end**: disposal is skipped (`_disposed` stays false) but the Dispatcher may be dead; `HasShutdownStarted`/`HasShutdownFinished` checks prevent deadlocks.

Pure services (`DataService`, `DailyStatsService`, helpers) do **not** need dispatcher guards — they have no UI bindings.

### Troubleshooting View Auto-scroll Behavior

- Log viewer automatically scrolls to the bottom when:
  - The tab becomes visible (`IsVisibleChanged` event fires true)
  - New log content is loaded (`LogContent` property changes)
  - Logs are refreshed via `RefreshLogs()` command
- Scrolling uses `DispatcherPriority.Background` to allow layout to settle before scroll
- Search and entry parsing preserve scroll position only when actively searching; log load and visibility changes always trigger scroll-to-bottom

### Documentation Entry Points

- `README.md` = project overview, quick-start, and release doc links
- `docs/RELEASE_PROCESS.md` = versioning and packaging workflow
- `docs/PRODUCTION_READINESS_PLAN.md` = tracked production readiness plan
